# 🚀 Full-Stack Project Prompt: AI-Driven Personalized Learning Platform (Online Version)

## Overview
You are a **Full-Stack Developer** tasked with building a production-ready **AI-Driven Personalized Learning Platform** for students in semi-urban and rural regions.  
The platform must be fully functional **online** (no offline mode for now) and powered by **AI-based adaptive learning** using Azure OpenAI GPT-4.1.  
It should support authentication, personalized content, AI-driven insights, analytics, and engagement tools for both students and teachers.

---

## Problem Statement
Educational institutions in semi-urban and rural areas face major challenges in offering **personalized learning experiences** that adapt to different learning speeds and styles.  
We need an **AI-enabled platform** that helps each student learn at their own pace, identifies weak areas, and provides real-time personalized feedback to improve understanding and outcomes.

---

## Background
Traditional classroom methods are designed for uniform learning and fail to address the unique needs of every student.  
This platform will use **AI and data analytics** to deliver personalized learning journeys and enable teachers to track student performance intelligently.

---

## Core Objectives
1. Deliver personalized learning paths for each student.  
2. Provide real-time AI feedback on assessments and performance.  
3. Offer detailed analytics dashboards for both teachers and students.  
4. Include engagement tools like gamification and rewards.  
5. Enable live and recorded class sessions for remote learning.  
6. Support multilingual users and accessibility compliance.  
7. Include collaboration features for teachers and parents.  
8. Include a GPT-4.1-powered learning assistant chatbot (online only).

## Must-Have Features
1. **User Authentication & Roles**  
   - Secure signup and login system  
   - Roles: Student, Teacher, Admin  

2. **AI-Powered Personalized Learning**  
   - Adaptive algorithm that tailors learning paths based on quiz results and interactions  
   - AI-generated feedback and next-topic recommendations  

3. **Assessments & Real-Time Feedback**  
   - Auto-generated quizzes  
   - AI feedback with performance suggestions  

4. **Progress Tracking & Analytics**  
   - Visual dashboards showing completion, progress, and improvement metrics  
   - Performance comparison and teacher insights  

5. **Gamification Layer**  
   - Badges, points, leaderboards, and achievement tracking  

6. **Collaboration & Communication**  
   - Teachers can message students or parents about progress  
   - Discussion boards or group activities  

7. **Live & Recorded Sessions**  
   - Integration for attending live classes and viewing recorded ones  

8. **AI Chatbot for Assistance**  
   - GPT-4.1 model integrated to assist students with study queries  
   - Capable of explaining topics, summarizing lessons, and suggesting practice exercises  

9. **Security & Privacy**  
   - Use secure APIs, hashed passwords, and protected routes  
   - Ensure student data privacy and compliance with data standards  

10. **Cloud Database Integration**  
   - Use MongoDB Atlas connection:  
     ```
     mongodb+srv://cropio:cropio@cluster0.hchim04.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
     ```

## AI Configuration (Azure OpenAI GPT-4.1)
Use the following configuration for all AI modules such as chatbot, adaptive feedback, and learning recommendations:

```js
import OpenAI from "openai";

const endpoint = "https://tecos.cognitiveservices.azure.com/openai/v1/";
const modelName = "gpt-4.1";
const deployment_name = "gpt-4.1";
const api_key = "AN3B455O036BdBPJxNF5mWNHuj1TknSXzZZUovcGmIUyfsc6SQUTJQQJ99BJACYeBjFXJ3w3AAAAACOGtQ0D";

const client = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: endpoint,
  apiKey: api_key,
});

async function main() {
  const completion = await client.chat.completions.create({
    model: deployment_name,
    messages: [
      { role: "system", content: "You are an AI tutor that helps students understand complex topics in simple ways." },
      { role: "user", content: "Explain Ohm’s Law in simple terms." },
    ],
  });

  console.log(completion.choices[0]);
}

main();
````

## Development Instructions

You are responsible for designing and implementing **both backend and frontend** parts of the system.
The architecture should support scalability, modularity, and clean separation of components.

### Step-by-Step Tasks

1. **Setup Project**

   * Initialize full-stack structure (frontend + backend).
   * Configure environment variables for database and API keys.

2. **Backend APIs**

   * Authentication (JWT-based)
   * Users, Courses, Assessments, Progress, Chatbot, Rewards endpoints
   * Integration with Azure OpenAI GPT-4.1 for adaptive feedback

3. **Frontend Application**

   * Create a clean, responsive UI
   * Implement login/signup flow
   * Build dashboards for students and teachers
   * Add chatbot UI connected to GPT-4.1 backend route
   * Display analytics and gamified rewards visually

4. **Learning Recommendation Engine**

   * Use AI responses to suggest topics, exercises, or study materials
   * Store interaction data for personalization

5. **Analytics Module**

   * Display student progress with charts and summaries
   * Teacher dashboard to monitor classroom-level performance

6. **Security & Data Integrity**

   * Use proper authentication middleware
   * Sanitize all user inputs
   * Encrypt passwords and sensitive data
   * Restrict endpoints by role

7. **Deployment**

   * Deploy backend and frontend to production-ready cloud platforms
   * Ensure database connection and AI API calls function correctly in production
